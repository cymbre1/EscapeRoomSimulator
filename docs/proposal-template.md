# Introduction

Our project is an escape room simulator. The premise of the escape room is that you have been locked in Target after a not so fun trip to the bathroom. The locks are broken and there is no way to exit through the back employee entrance without a manager keycard. In order to get the manager keycard, you must get into the manager office which is locked by a number combination pad. There are other puzzles and obstacles that must be overcome before you can escape the store.

We are planning to have the escape room encapsulated within a script so that the escape room framework can be used for multiple escape room scenarios, one of which will be the one that we develop for this project. The scenario that we are developing for the Target escape room will be the one for this project. 

# Anticipated Technologies

We are planning to use Java for development as well as UI using Swing and use JUnit tests. We are also planning to use Github as source control for our project. 

# Method/Approach

We are interested in trying to do test driven development as well as Agile. We are planning to meet once a week every Friday after class and communicate via Discord. We are planning to use Github projects as our scrum board.

# Anticipated Problems

We anticipate it being difficult to make our UI look like a terminal. We anticipate learning git and implementing it will be a difficult but useful task. We anticipate the UI design might be difficult since we are not especially experienced with UI design. We anticipate that it will be difficult to have our escape room framework usable for different escape room scenarios.
