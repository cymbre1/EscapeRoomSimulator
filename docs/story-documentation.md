# Target Escape Room Scenario
On a shopping trip to target, you take a not so fun trip to the bathroom right before the store closes. When you emerge from the bathroom and head towards the front door of the store, you discover that you've been locked in. You start to panic because you have an 8am comprehensive anatomy final exam in the morning that you can't miss. 
* On the front door, there is a note from the store manager to the assistant manager 
    * "Eric, the front doors are broken so they can only be locked/unlocked from the outside. The maintenance man is coming to fix it in the morning, but if you happen to get locked in tonight for some reason just use my keycard in the counting area of the checkout office to get out through the employee door. You know the code. Thanks, Jessica"
    * P.S. Check the lights
    * P.P.S. if you need to get into my locker, think about my Starbucks order (Is this unnecessary? We could go without and then add it if people have trouble getting started. )

After you have been to the door and discovered the note, your panic subsides a little as you realize there could be a way out. You check the checkout office door, but its locked with no indication of what 3 number code is. You can choose whether you would like to go to go back to the restroom, or to the Starbucks which is next to the checkout area.

## Starbucks
The Starbucks appears like any other Starbucks, there's nothing too special about it. On the wall, there is a note labeled "Jessica's Order" which reads
```
Jessica's Order
Trenta Iced Latte
5 pumps Caramel
7 pumps White chocolate
Hazelnut (just a splash)
4 Extra Shots
Extra Whip
Cinnamon/Caramel Garnish
Macademia Nut Milk
No Ice
```
* This clue unlocks Jessica's locker with the combination 5-3-6 which she chose because of her Starbucks order. 

## Restroom
Back in the restroom, you see that there are things strewn around the floor from the day, it doesn't look like anyone bothered to clean the bathroom today, which explains how you ended up in this mess. On the wall there is a cleaning schedule which looks like
* Insert cleaning schedule image. It has initials on the calendar days in a repeating pattern. 
* This cleaning schedule unlocks the break room when you use the repeating pattern on the combination pad. 

## The Break Room
Once you open up the breakroom, you step into a dark room. After turning on the light, you see that there are lockers lining the edges of the room. There is a door labeled "Manager Office" inside the room There is also a fridge and a few couches in the breakroom for employees to relax and eat while on their break. You see that all of the locker codes have 3 digit number codes, so when you see the one labeled "Jessica" in pink letters, you know that this must be the locker that Jessica talked about in her note.
* You must input the 3 numbers from the Starbucks order into the locker combination to unlock Jessica's locker. 

## Jessica's Locker
Inside Jessica's locker, you find a industrial looking key and a shopping list. It reads
```
Shopping List
-Something
-Something else
-I don't really know
```
* Use the aisle numbers of the items on Jessica's list to unlock the manager computer

## Jessica's Office
To your surprise, Jessica's office is not locked. Inside, you see a small room - basically a closet with a small desk with an ancient computer on it. There's not much else in the room, just some inspirational quotes hung crookedly on the dingy walls and a small shelf with a collection of assorted colored Starbucks tumblrs. When you turn on the computer, you discover that it's looking for a password. The computer pops up a password hint, which says "aisle numbers"

Once you have unlocked Jessica's computer, you can see that she has little reminders all over her desktop background which remind her of certain things, for example
* Have Carl take out the trash
* Reschedule Maya's days, she can't work Saturdays
* Counting Room Passcode: 9996352
* There could also be an option to change the password on Jessica's Computer

The counting room passcode will help you get into the super locked door

## Checkout Area
You head down the the checkout office now that you have the passcode to the counting room. Except, you didn't realize the checkout office would be locked. In the checkout area, the lights on aisles 2,6, and 7 are on, which is odd considering the store is closed

* You have to punch in the numbers of the on office light into the number pad on the checkout office to get in. 

## Checkout Office
Once you get into the checkout office, you can see it: The counting room door. You see that it requries a passcode and a key, both of which you have already found. Once you open the door, you can see the manager keycard hanging on a hook. You grab it and head for the back door. It is 7:15am and your exam is at 8!

You sprint to the back door and use the keycard to open it up. You rush to your car and drive to your exam and arrive just on time, 2 minutes before the final started.
